										<p>As I grow older, more important decisions come my way. In the midst of these times, I struggle to find what path I should take. People tell me different viewpoints; some are facts, and some are just opinions. There’s so much to consider. How do I know what’s real and what’s just a myth?</p>
										<p>The words of my mentors, family, and friends convolute and leave me stranded in a world I don’t know how to navigate. I look around, and I don’t know what to focus on. The ones close by? The ones afar? The sharp ones? The hazy ones?</p> 
										<p>This structure represents the convoluted situations of life. Parts of it are real. Parts of it are simply reflections that mimic reality.

										<p>As a frugal person, I couldn’t let myself throw away my old tie dye shirts, so I decide to repurpose them. Last year, I saw a friend drape a piece of clothing into many different styles. Inspired, I wanted to experiment with draping. But when I got 4 shirts in, I was suddenly drawn more toward the texture and pattern of my materials. With draping still in the back of mind, I sought out materials with varied texture to add dimension to this fashion piece. Inevitably, this piece became about the integration of numerous fabrics and textures in a modern tribal dress. My design is capable of shifting into various forms under different circumstances. It is malleable, adaptable, and fluid.</p>

										<p>Several years ago, the trees in my backyard mysteriously began to die. Currently, the leaves on our orange tree are turning yellow, and the branches are turning white.</p>
										<p>These systematic events made my family wonder if something in the ground was killing our trees. After some thought, my father remembered the chemical leakage from a tank on the PG&E telephone pole that saturated our soil a couple years ago. I’m now afraid to eat the oranges from the tree, and my family is concerned about the long-term exposure to those chemicals affecting our health. At the time, PG&E quickly fixed the leakage but never warned us about any detrimental affects the chemicals may cause.</p>
										<p>I created this sculpture using leaves and branches from my yard. The fallen leaves and empty branches represent the damage caused by industrial progress, while the wheelchair symbolizes our family’s fear about our future health.</p>

										<p>I used to put very little thought into what I ate. But, when I worked at a camp for people with mental or physical disabilities, I saw how careful many campers had to be with their diets. Their diets restricted them. For a camper with Type II Diabetes, eating too many fruits and vegetables could raise the blood sugar to dangerous levels. I saw people who were unable to eat fed through a G-tube. This sculpture represents how I will never look at food the same way again. I don’t take my unrestrictive diet for granted, and I’m aware that the simple act of eating can be both limiting and liberating.</p>

										<p>After reading Black Swan Green, a coming of age novel about a teenage boy with a stutter, I began to think more about speech impediments. Although learning the pronunciation for different languages, such as Spanish or Chinese, was challenging for me, it’s incomparable to the difficulties others have had to overcome due to speech impediments.</p>
										<p>This piece depicts my interpretation drawn from the insight I gained reading Black Swan Green, of what it feels like to battle a speech impediment. A cup is meant for drinking, but as one brings the cup towards one's lips, one is hindered. The fingers enter one's mouth and then proceed to one's throat. They grab hold and prevent sound from coming out even though one tries as hard as one can to fight it. It, the speech impediment, takes over, and the only thing others see are open lips with no sound emanating from them.</p>

										<p>Instead of exploring the definition of the given topic word, forge, I chose to explore an idea and concept the word embodies: artificiality, the notion of pretending to be something one is not. I wanted my execution and medium to reflect my opinion on deception in human behavior. With water soluble inks and paints, I painted words representing artificial qualities and aspects I have experienced, such as appearances, relationships, and compliments. I assembled these words on a mask to symbolize how people hide behind a wall of lies and fake impressions. Then, I sprayed and exposed the mask to water, allowing the inks and paints to dissolve. I wanted the words to blend and become indiscernible to illustrate how people can see through the falsities. The wearing down of the words into a blob of nothing shows how artificiality is meaningless and not genuine. It will lose its value over time, while authenticity will last.</p>

								<p>This photography book is centered around the idea of the beauty and power of defying stereotypes. I wanted to illustrate the uniqueness and beauty of seeing the world from a different point of view, not the common one everyone else sees. With photography as my medium, I ventured around my community to photograph commonly witnessed items and sceneries in unusual and different ways.

								<p> I was inspired to create this piece as I stared at a mirror in a small coffee shop. My former optic lessons in physics class flooded back into my memory as I pondered over lenses, mirrors, virtual images, and real images. These concepts led me to reflect on the illusion, deception, and perception in this world, which is what this book is about. Through simple images, my book transitions from illustrating how most people are deceived to how each person’s perception of the world is shaped by various factors, such as education, culture, and family. I chose to present my book in a circular format instead of using a traditional book binding technique because I wanted the presentation to add to my message. The circular shape of the book and the clear plastic the viewer initially looks through helps convey the idea that everyone sees the world through a different lens.</p>
